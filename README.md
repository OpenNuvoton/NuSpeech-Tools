+ Fix: Format menu didn't show correctly in resource window. Volume Boost menu didn't show selected item in resource window.
+ Hide FW PWM Frequency option in UltraIO Property Dialog.
+ Use lower case letter in equation name would cause play by index mechanism linking error. 
+ If resource is edited, building project would cause linking error that cannot find resource section.
+ After switching chip the SDS didn't force rebuild project so it link the wrong .lic and cause linking error.
+ Some optional Functions are not saved after close then open project.
+ Make unused pins to be output low to avoid currency leakage.
